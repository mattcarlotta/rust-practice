// 5.  What a mess -- functions in a binary! Let's get organized!
//
// - Make a library file (src/lib.rs)
// - Move all the functions (except main) into the library
// - Make all the functions public with `pub`
// - Bring all the functions into scope using use statements. Remember, the name of the library
//   is defined in Cargo.toml.  You'll need to know that to `use` it.
//
// `cargo run` should produce the same output, only now the code is more organized. ðŸŽ‰

    // body to use x and y.
